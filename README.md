# Justdial Scraper
Interested in using this scraper? Get it here: [Justdial Scraper](https://apify.com/curious_coder/justdial-scraper)
## How it works

Search with required filters and once you are done copy the link from address bar and paste it to actor `Search URL` input field.

You can optionally enable `Fetch phone numbers` option, but it will slow down the process by 2x.

You can customise and randomise the delay between scraping pages by adjusting parameters. 

## Pagination

You can use `Start page` and `End page` parameters to scrape range of pages

For eg, if you want to scrape first 50 results, set `Start page` = 1 and `End page` = 5. For next 50 results, set `Start page` = 6 and `End page` = 10 and so on.

Here is the sample output of this actor:
